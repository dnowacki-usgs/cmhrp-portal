These data were collected in the eastern Gulf of Mexico near Tampa Bay, Florida, at the University of South Florida Coastal Ocean and Monitoring Prediction System (COMPS) Buoy C12 by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) St. Petersburg Coastal and Marine Science Center using an autonomous instrument package called the Ocean Carbon System version 3 (OCSv3). The OCSv3 consists of four sensors integrated using a Sea-Bird Stor-X data logger including a Sea-Bird SeapHOx pH sensor, a Sea-Bird SBE 37-SMP-ODO MicroCAT C-T-ODO (P) Recorder, a Pro-Oceanus CO2-Pro CV sensor, and a Wetlabs Eco-PAR sensor. Each parameter was measured hourly over multiple twenty-four hour time periods, ranging from weeks to months.\"\"\""

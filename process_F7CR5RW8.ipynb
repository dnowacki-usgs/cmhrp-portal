    "Time-series data of velocity, pressure, turbidity, conductivity, and temperature were collected near the mouth of the Elwha River, Washington, USA, from December 2010 through October 2014, for the Department of Interiorâ€™s Elwha River Restoration project. As part of this project, the U.S. Geological Survey studied the effects of renewed sediment supplies on the coastal ecosystems before, during, and following the removal of two dams, Elwha and Glines Canyon, from the Elwha River. Removal of the dams reintroduced sediment stored in the reservoirs to the river, and the river moved much of this sediment to the coast. \n",
    " \n",
    "Several benthic tripods were instrumented with oceanographic sensors to collect the time-series data. Initial deployment in December 2010 consisted of one tripod about 1 km east of the Elwha River mouth (Tripod A). In March of 2011, an identical tripod (Tripod B) was placed about 1 km west of the river mouth. A mooring was added to the western site in July 2012 to measure turbidity and conductivity near the surface. A third tripod was placed in deeper water (50 m) directly offshore of the river mouth in an attempt to characterize sediment gravity flows near the seafloor if they occurred (Tripod C). Exceptional sedimentation was observed near the original tripod site A during the winter of 2013-2014. As a result, the tripod was relocated further east in April 2013 and renamed Tripod D.\n",

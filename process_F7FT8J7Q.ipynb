In addition, a bottom platform to the South of the canyon head (MS0) housed instrumentation to measure currents and waves on the adjacent shelf. The mooring diagram image files are a generalized representation of the deployed instrumentation at each site, and are included as a visual aid for understanding the sampling environment. A text file of the specific sensors listing the parameters measured is also included.\"\"\""
